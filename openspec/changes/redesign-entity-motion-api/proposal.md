## What This Is

`useEntityAnimation` is a React Hook for animating a 3D object (an Entity) in the scene, letting it move, rotate, or scale smoothly.

`useEntityAnimation` provides three core capabilities:

1. **Keyframe animation (`timeline`)**: do a simple "from A to B" motion, or write multi-step animations like `0% → 50% → 100%`.
2. **Result write-back (`entityProps`)**: the Hook hands the animation's final pose back to you, so the object stays put at the end instead of snapping back.
3. **Recommended binding (`xr-animation`)**: binds the animation to the object; the `animation` binding also works.

> **A few basic terms** (used throughout):
> - **Entity**: a 3D object in the scene, e.g. a box `<BoxEntity>`.
> - **transform**: the object's spatial pose, made of three parts — position `position` (unit: meters), rotation `rotation` (unit: degrees), and scale `scale` (a multiplier, 1 = original size).
> - **`Vec3`**: a 3D vector shaped like `{ x, y, z }`, used for the three axes of each part above.
> - **component**: one of `position` / `rotation` / `scale`.

## I Want To Do X — What Do I Use (Quick Reference)

| What I want to do | What to use |
|---|---|
| Move/rotate/scale an object from one pose to another | Write `from` / `to` in the config |
| Do a multi-step keyframe animation (e.g. 0% → 50% → 100%) | Write `timeline` in the config |
| Keep the object at the end pose after the animation, no snap-back | Spread `{...entityProps}` onto the component |
| Move the object to a new pose in code after the animation | Call `api.set({ ... })` |
| Let the animation control position only, keep rotation manual | Put only `position` in the config; keep passing `rotation` via props |
| Read the final pose the animation hands back | Read `entityProps` (there is no `api.get`) |
| Control playback (start/pause/resume/stop/reset) | `api.play()` / `pause()` / `resume()` / `stop()` / `reset()` / `finish()` |
| Check whether the runtime supports animation | `supports('useAnimation')` |

> **Transform only**: this version can animate `position` / `rotation` / `scale` only. It does **not** support `opacity`, material, color, etc. Targeting something unsupported throws an error rather than being silently ignored.

## Quick Start: A Complete Example

```tsx
import { useEntityAnimation } from '...'

function MyBox() {
  // Move the box up by 0.25m and scale it to 1.1x over 0.8s
  const [animation, api, entityProps] = useEntityAnimation({
    from: { position: { x: 0, y: 0, z: 0.8 }, scale: { x: 1, y: 1, z: 1 } },
    to:   { position: { y: 0.25 },            scale: { x: 1.1, y: 1.1, z: 1.1 } },
    duration: 0.8,
    autoStart: true,
    onComplete: () => console.log('animation done'),
  })

  return (
    <Reality>
      <SceneGraph>
        {/* Put entityProps last so the object stays at the end pose */}
        <BoxEntity {...entityProps} xr-animation={animation} />
      </SceneGraph>
    </Reality>
  )
}
```

The Hook returns three values, destructured in order:

```tsx
const [animation, api, entityProps] = useEntityAnimation(config)
```

| Return value | What it does |
|---|---|
| `animation` | The animation binding; pass it to the component's `xr-animation` (or `animation`) prop |
| `api` | The playback controller; provides `play / pause / resume / stop / reset / finish` and `set` |
| `entityProps` | The final pose handed back at key moments (not a live per-frame value), shaped like `{ position?, rotation?, scale? }`; spread it onto the component |

## Describing the Animation (config)

### Option 1: from / to (from one pose to another)

```tsx
const [animation, api, entityProps] = useEntityAnimation({
  from: {
    position: { x: 0, y: 0, z: 0.8 },
    rotation: { x: 0, y: 0, z: 0 },
    scale: { x: 1, y: 1, z: 1 },
  },
  to: {
    position: { y: 0.25 },
    scale: { x: 1.1, y: 1.1, z: 1.1 },
  },
  duration: 0.8,
  autoStart: true,
})
```

Both `from` and `to` can list only the fields you care about; unlisted fields stay unchanged.

### Option 2: timeline (multi-step keyframes)

Use percentages to describe the pose at different points in time — good for more complex motion:

```tsx
const [animation, api, entityProps] = useEntityAnimation({
  duration: 1.2,
  timingFunction: 'easeInOut',
  timeline: {
    '0%': {
      position: { x: 0, y: 0, z: 0.8 },
      scale: { x: 1, y: 1, z: 1 },
    },
    '50%': {
      position: { y: 0.25 },
      scale: { x: 1.1, y: 1.1, z: 1.1 },
    },
    '100%': {
      position: { y: 0 },
      scale: { x: 1, y: 1, z: 1 },
    },
  },
})
```

### Which Fields You Can Write

The config accepts only these fields (matching the Entity's own prop hierarchy):

```text
position.x / position.y / position.z
rotation.x / rotation.y / rotation.z
scale.x    / scale.y    / scale.z
```

Targeting something unsupported like `opacity` throws an error or triggers `onError`; it is never silently ignored.

## Keeping the Result at the End Pose (entityProps)

`entityProps` is the third value returned by the Hook — it is the **final pose the animation hands back** at key moments (see "When it updates" below), not a value that refreshes every frame. Spread it onto the component so the object stays at the end pose after the animation:

```tsx
const [animation, api, entityProps] = useEntityAnimation({
  to: {
    position: { x: 0.1, y: 0, z: 0 },
    rotation: { y: 90 },
    scale: { x: 1, y: 1, z: 1 },
  },
})

return (
  <BoxEntity {...entityProps} xr-animation={animation} />
)
```

You can also use the `animation` binding:

```tsx
<BoxEntity {...entityProps} animation={animation} />
```

**After the animation completes**, `entityProps` updates to the end pose (position, rotation, scale); the object stays on its last frame and **does not snap back to the start**.

**When it updates**: `entityProps` does not update every frame. It only updates at key moments: when playback starts, completes, stops, resets, finishes, and when an `api.set` write succeeds.

> **Note**: before the first playback, or before the first successful `api.set`, `entityProps` may be empty. Do not assume it already has a value right when the component mounts — play the animation once, or call `api.set` successfully once, and it will then hold a value.

---

## Moving the Object in Code After the Animation (api.set)

Once the animation is done, if you want to move the object to a new pose from code, call `api.set`:

```tsx
// Raise the box to y = 0.3 (everything else unchanged)
api.set({ position: { y: 0.3 } })
```

A few rules:

1. **Use it only while the animation is not playing** (this includes: never played, already finished, stopped / reset). As long as the animation is playing (including delay and paused), calling `api.set` is ignored (it neither interrupts the animation nor gets queued for later replay), and it triggers the `onError` callback you passed in the config; the object stays unchanged and `entityProps` does not update. To take over the object mid-animation, stop the animation first, or wait until it ends.
2. **Pass only the fields you want to change**; the rest stay as they are. For example, `api.set({ position: { y: 0.3 } })` does not touch `rotation` or `scale`.
3. **On a successful write, `entityProps` updates** to the new pose; if the write does not take effect, `entityProps` stays unchanged and `onError` fires. Use it to detect a failed write:
```tsx
useEntityAnimation({
  onError: error => console.error('api.set write failed', error),
})
```
4. **Want to change based on the current value?** Read `entityProps` to get the current pose, compute the new value yourself, then pass it to `api.set`. There is no `api.get` here — in React, an imperative getter tends to read stale values and cause read-then-write conflicts.
5. **It is not a playback command**: `api.set` does not start playback or change playback progress.

### Where Playback Starts After api.set

- If the config declares `from`: playback starts from `from`.
- If `from` is not declared: playback starts from the current pose (the value `api.set` just wrote).

---

## Who Wins: Animation vs. Your Props

The object's pose can be influenced from two sides at once: the props you pass manually (including `entityProps`), and the animation that is playing. The rule is decided **per component (`position` / `rotation` / `scale`), independently**:

| Situation | Who wins |
|---|---|
| The component is written in the config AND the animation is playing (including delay, paused) | The animation |
| Otherwise (the component is not in the config, or the animation has ended / not started) | Your props / `api.set` |

This matches CSS animations: while playing, the animation takes over these transform properties per property; properties it does not cover — and these transform properties once the animation ends — are handed back to you.

A few practical takeaways follow:

- **While the animation is playing**, the properties listed in the config are taken over by the animation, so writing them via props has no effect; properties not in the config are still controlled by props as usual.
- **"Let the animation control position only, keep rotation on props" is supported** — just put only `position` in the config and leave out `rotation`.
- **After the animation ends**, these transform properties go back to being controlled by props (including `entityProps`), and the object stays at the end pose.

### Recommended Pattern

Put `entityProps` **after** your other props, so the object correctly stays at the end pose after the animation instead of being overwritten by older prop values:

```tsx
<BoxEntity
  position={basePosition}
  {...entityProps}
  xr-animation={animation}
/>
```

## api Methods Overview

`api` provides the following methods:

```tsx
api.play()      // start playing
api.pause()     // pause
api.resume()    // resume from pause
api.stop()      // stop
api.reset()     // reset
api.finish()    // jump straight to the end state
api.set(values) // set a pose (see "Moving the Object in Code After the Animation" above)
```

The first six are **playback controls** that operate the animation's playback progress; `api.set` is a **pose setter** that changes the object's static pose directly and does not affect playback progress. All of them live on `api` but serve different purposes: use the first six to control the animation, and use `api.set` to place the object by hand after the animation ends.

---

## Animation States

During its lifecycle an animation moves through the states below. Reading this diagram helps you tell, at any moment: whether `api.set` is usable, whether `entityProps` updates, and who controls the object.

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    state "NotStarted" as NotStarted
    state "Playing (incl. delay, paused)" as Playing
    state "Ended" as Ended

    [*] --> NotStarted
    NotStarted --> Playing: play() / autoStart
    Playing --> Playing: pause() / resume()
    Playing --> Ended: reaches end / finish() / stop()
    Ended --> Playing: play() (replay)
    Ended --> NotStarted: reset()
    Playing --> NotStarted: reset()

    note right of Playing
        The "active" state, incl. the start delay and paused
        Properties present in the config are owned by the animation
        api.set is ignored here and triggers onError
    end note
    note right of Ended
        complete / stop / finish stops at the matching pose
        entityProps updates to that pose
        properties are handed back to your props / api.set
    end note
```

> "Playing" in the diagram covers the **start delay** and **paused** as well — as long as the animation has not ended and has not been reset, it counts as "active", and `api.set` is rejected.

### Behavior in Each State

| State | How to enter | Is `api.set` usable | Does `entityProps` update | Who controls the transform |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Not started** | Initial state; or after `reset()` | ✅ Usable | No (may be empty — do not rely on it at mount) | Your props |
| **Playing** (incl. delay, paused) | `play()` / `autoStart`; still counts after `pause()` | ❌ Ignored, triggers `onError` | Only once, at the moment playback starts | The animation (properties present in the config); the rest by your props |
| **Ended** | Reaches the end, `complete` / `stop` / `finish` | ✅ Usable | ✅ Updates to the final pose (`stop` freezes at current, `finish`/`complete` at the end) | Your props / `api.set` |

> **Note**: a looping animation has no natural "reaches end", so `entityProps` does not update at each loop boundary during looping; only `stop()` / `finish()` or a successful `api.set` updates it.

---

## Event Callbacks (callback)

You can pass callbacks in the config to get notified at different stages of the animation:

```tsx
useEntityAnimation({
  // ...
  onStart:    values => console.log('start', values),
  onComplete: values => console.log('complete', values),
  onStop:     values => console.log('stop', values),
  onReset:    values => console.log('reset', values),
  onError:    error  => console.error('error', error),
})
```

Callbacks are **notifications only**. Their return values are ignored and cannot decide where the object ends up. To decide the end pose, declare it in the config before playback (e.g. via `to`), or take over after playback through `entityProps` / `api.set`.

The `values` passed to callbacks contain only the fields Entity supports:

```text
{ position?: Vec3, rotation?: Vec3, scale?: Vec3 }
```

---

## Checking Runtime Support

Use capability detection to check whether the current runtime supports animation:

```tsx
supports('useAnimation')
```

Meaning: the current runtime supports binding animation to an Entity via `xr-animation` (or `animation`).

If it returns `false`, the current runtime does not support animation; skip the animation and render the object at its target pose with static props instead:

```tsx
if (supports('useAnimation')) {
  return <BoxEntity {...entityProps} xr-animation={animation} />
}
// Not supported: render straight to the final pose, no animation
return <BoxEntity position={targetPosition} />
```

**This version supports transform only (`position` / `rotation` / `scale`); it does not support `opacity`.**

---

## Limitations (This Version)

This version can **animate transform only** (`position` / `rotation` / `scale`); it does not support opacity (`opacity`), material, color, or other properties. In addition, an animation object binds to a single object and cannot be shared across multiple objects.

---

## One-Line Summary

`useEntityAnimation` describes animation with `position / rotation / scale`, and supports percentage `timeline`, `entityProps` result write-back, and the recommended `xr-animation` binding; this version supports transform only, not opacity.
