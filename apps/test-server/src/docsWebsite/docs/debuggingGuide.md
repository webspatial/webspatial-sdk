# Debugging guide

##  Print to console
When running WebSpatial on device or simulator, you can log to the platform console (eg. in XCode) using the WebSpatial session log API.

```
    session.log("Hello World");
```

## Inspect safari pages

To debug actual webpage elements, you can use the safari debug tool from your PC to inspect WebSpatial elements running on the device or simulator.
