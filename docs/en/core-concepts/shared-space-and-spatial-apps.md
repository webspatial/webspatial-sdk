# Shared Space and Spatial Apps

## Shared Space

The spatial-computing architecture introduced by visionOS provides a brand-new runtime environment called **Shared Space**.

A Shared Space is a [Mixed Reality](#) 3D environment that matches the physical space around you.

Within this single 3D space, multiple apps can coexist harmoniously – they fit naturally into the real-world environment **and** with one another.

These **Multitasking Apps** include not only traditional 2D apps but also **Spatial Apps** that take advantage of 3D space and contain 3D content.

## Spatial Apps

Inside a Shared Space, an app’s content is no longer confined to the plane of a 2D window; it **can extend into the 3D volume in front of that plane**. Positioning and layout gain a true Z-axis in addition to X and Y.

Content is no longer limited to 2D window containers. It can be placed in spatial containers that have volume, similar to 3D bounding boxes.

An app can be made up of [multiple such content containers](#), all of which are **[managed uniformly](#) by the spatial-computing OS**.

Many 2D UI elements that make up the content can be **[spatialized](#)**, meaning they enter 3D space where they can be positioned, laid out, and transformed.

You can also use [3D UI elements](#) to build richer, fully featured 3D content. These 3D elements can **be laid out together with 2D UI elements** along the X, Y, and Z axes, creating more sophisticated **mixed 2D-and-3D** UI components.

Apps built this way are called **Spatial Apps**.

Spatial Apps are the [new generation of XR apps](#). They **preserve the strengths of 2D apps** from desktop and mobile platforms while gaining **optional, progressive [spatial enhancements](#)** on spatial-computing platforms.

## Unified Rendering

Spatial Apps do not need to implement their own custom renderers or full XR interaction stacks. Instead, the OS that provides the Shared Space offers a unified rendering service and handles fundamental natural interactions (for example, [gaze and hand interaction](#)).

Multiple Spatial Apps can **blend into a single coordinate system and lighting environment** inside the Shared Space, complete with positional relationships, occlusion, shadows, and more.

Because of this, Spatial Apps cannot freely build independent rendering pipelines. Instead, they expose content through OS-managed 2D/3D containers called **[Scenes](#)** and describe that content via APIs the OS understands ([spatialized 2D UI elements and 3D UI elements](#)). This lets the OS understand and manage the content, enabling **Unified Rendering**.
