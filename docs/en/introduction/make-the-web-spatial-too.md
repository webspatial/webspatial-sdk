**WebSpatial** is a set of [spatial APIs]() built on top of the mainstream Web-development ecosystem and existing 2D Web. It enables the entire HTML/CSS-based Web world—billions of sites and Web apps, tens of millions of Web developers, and millions of open-source libraries—to step into the spatial era, **gaining spatial power on par with native visionOS apps while keeping all the advantages they already have**.

### Position HTML Elements on the Z Axis

With WebSpatial, **HTML elements** can be laid out and positioned not only along the X and Y axes via CSS, but also **along the Z axis in front of the page**:

### Transform HTML Elements in True 3D

WebSpatial lets HTML elements [**rotate, scale, and warp along the Z axis in real space**](). For example, you can build an actual 3-D “object” out of plain `div` elements:

### Material-Based Backgrounds

HTML elements can have backgrounds that are [**semi-transparent materials rendered in real time from the environment**](), so content stays legible under any color and lighting conditions. You can also set the background of an element—or an entire page window—to a [**fully transparent material**](), making its contents appear to float and disperse in space.

### Genuine 3D Elements for HTML

WebSpatial adds **[true 3D elements]()** to HTML, allowing 3-D content to appear directly in space:

These 3-D elements can [**participate in layout alongside 2-D elements**](), forming any mix of Web content and graphical UI:

### Multi-Scene Web Apps

A Web app can comprise multiple **[scenes]()**, just like a native spatial app. These 2-D + 3-D (or pure 3-D) scenes can be [**managed as standard Web windows**]() and can also receive [**scene-specific spatial initialization**]().

### 3-D Containers with Engine APIs (v1.1 feature)

Among the 3-D elements WebSpatial adds to HTML is a container type that lets you **render and control its 3-D content via engine-level APIs**. Web 3-D programming is no longer limited to flat canvases or a handful of full-screen 3-D games (including space-hogging WebXR games). It can now serve multitasking scenarios and a far wider range of applications.
