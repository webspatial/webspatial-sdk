## 2D Web Developers

If you are a 2D Web developer, WebSpatial lowers the **threshold** and **cost** of building spatial apps to almost nothing for you (especially when you already have existing Web App projects).

Although spatial-computing platforms and XR devices (including Vision Pro-like headsets that are becoming lighter and more affordable, and AI/AR glasses with rapidly advancing GUI capabilities) do not yet have the same large user base as desktop/mobile platforms, WebSpatial's **cross-platform support** and **low adaptation cost** let you confidently enter these next-gen computing platforms early. You can keep exploring and practicing user experience, UI design, functionality, and use cases while gaining experience and insights. Once opportunities emerge in these platforms or certain application areas, you will be ready to participate from day one.

You can publish your existing Web App in the spatial-computing platform's **app store**, gaining greater exposure, reputation, and sharing opportunities in a **less-competitive environment that is closer to some users**.

You can turn your existing Web App into an **"ultra-large-screen" experience** on spatial-computing platforms, fully leveraging the larger space to simplify the UI and enhance content.

You can enrich your existing Web App with **more vivid, intuitive and attractive 3D content and 3D GUI** on spatial-computing platforms.

You can give your existing Web App **more natural and diverse interaction methods** on spatial-computing platforms.

You can also activate **brand-new features and use cases designed specifically for XR users**, unlocking new possibilities for your existing Web App.

Once you are familiar with the API, you can create **entirely new apps for spatial-computing platforms at low cost** while preserving cross-platform compatibility for desktop and mobile, **serving every user group**.

## Native App Developers

If you are a native spatial app developer, you can follow **existing best practices in mobile development** by embedding **WebView containers powered by WebSpatial** in your native spatial app and letting the Web developers in your team maintain **dynamic content and frequently updated GUI** in your app.

With this kind of WebView, Web developers can implement not only 2D content and 2D GUI but can also meet product and design requirements that involve 3D and spatial capabilities, making this way of **boosting development efficiency** can work for most use cases.

## Web 3D Developers

If you are a 3D developer, especially a Web 3D developer, your existing 3D skills now have **far more opportunities and a larger stage**.

Previously, these 3D skills could be used only in a limited number of 3D-game cases; and because traditional 3D apps on XR platforms occupy the entire space, you had to make the app support the entire user case on its own, fully satisfying the user's needs and driving retention and engagement by yourself. This resulted in high implementation costs and revenue pressure.

With WebSpatial, you can get involved in **the much broader, more user-friendly, commonly used Shared Space mode and multi-app environments**. In all spatial apps built on 2D GUI architecture, **every 3D container** becomes a stage for you to apply and show off your 3D dev skills. The 3D effects and content you create can **appear in more places, reach more users, and stay closer to them**.

You also **do not need to carry the entire user case alone** anymore. You can develop widgets, companion apps, helper tools, on-demand apps, social mini-games, and many other types of applications. They are inexpensive to build and quick to iterate, allowing you to **experiment with more ideas and meet more user needs**.

Even though WebSpatial v1 has not officially provided a 3D-engine API and the related 3D container yet, you can **still let your existing WebXR games benefit from WebSpatial**:

### WebXR Developers

WebXR content is well suited to be used together with 2D web content. For example, GaaS (Games-as-a-Service) app's portal, lobby, item trading, and leaderboard features can all be implemented more efficiently and be more shareable in 2D webpages than through a 3D graphics API.

However, these 2D webpages were previously confined to flat windows with uniform backgrounds and borders, making them disjointed and inconsistent with the borderless WebXR content and limiting their capabilities. As soon as 3D content needed to be added, you had to switch from the webpage to WebXR session to implement it.

With WebSpatial, these **2D webpages that accompany WebXR games** can place UI in 3D space like WebXR content, embed true 3D content, and adopt a design language and theme similar to WebXR content, while still allowing the user to start a WebXR session with a single click. Users can **switch freely between WebXR mode and WebSpatial mode** at any time.
